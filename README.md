# Monopoly Dice Roll C++
###### C++

This project aims to emulate the dice system of Hasbro's Monopoly. It rolls 2 dice, and will grant an extra roll (up to 3 times) if doubles are present. Currently the only display functionality is terminal based, with terminal art to represent the faces of the dice.

### Requirements

Must be on Windows, or using a program that allows you to run C programs in a terminal.

### Installation and Running

Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can run the project on your local machine!

**Step 1:** Git Clone the project and save the contents to your local machine.

**Step 2:** Open a terminal window and navigate to the location of the .exe file.

**Step 3:** Run the exe file by typing this in your terminal window:
```
monopolyDiceRoll.exe
```

**Step 3:** _Done!_ The program should now be running in your terminal window if everything is working properly. ðŸ¤ž

### Usage

While the program is running it will continually ask you if you want to continue to run the program and roll more dice, which you can do by typing "Y". After each dice roll is completed it will print the total at the bottom in addition to the images, for enhanced readability. To exit the program simply type "N".
