# Monopoly Dice Roll C++
###### C++

This project aims to emulate the dice system of Hasbro's Monopoly. It rolls 2 dice, and will grant an extra roll (up to 3 times) if doubles are present. Currently the only display functionality is terminal based, with terminal art to represent the faces of the dice.
